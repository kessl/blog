<h1>Hi, my name is Daniel.<br>I make machines do things.</h1>

I'm a software developer by trade.
I enjoy creating software people find useful, from scratch to completion.

Some of my other interests include hardware hacking, self-propelled flying objects, ecology & permaculture, mountain hiking and woodworking; arbitrarily combined.

This site is a collection of random thoughts mostly related to software engineering.
