<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Daniel and I‚Äôm an absolute newb when it comes to kubernetes.
I also really like the idea of having a homelab to experiment on, self-host some apps and look at pretty lights and cables.
My original plan to rack-mount a HP DL380 G6 in my living room I <a href="https://youtu.be/eBTPKBm4vA4?t=36" target="_blank">abandoned rather quickly</a> in hopes of remaining in a relationship.</p>

<p>The next best thing I have is a random assortment of mostly ARM hardware, which I‚Äôll try to coerce into homelab stuff with the help of kubernetes.</p>

<p>I know next to nothing about kubernetes, so my setup will be a mashup of these great kubernetes guides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/</li>
  <li>https://blog.quickbird.uk/domesticating-kubernetes-d49c178ebc41</li>
  <li>https://kauri.io/38-install-and-configure-a-kubernetes-cluster-with/418b3bc1e0544fbc955a4bbba6fff8a9/a</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>

<p>The ultimate goal is to set up a homelab kubernetes environment on hardware that I have lying around.
I should be able to deploy apps to the cluster and have them be reachable on a subdomain of bitgate.cz over HTTPS.</p>

<p>I have a few apps in mind that I‚Äôd like to eventually host:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank">NextCloud</a></strong> - self-hosted file sharing &amp; document tools</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_blank">Jellyfin</a>, Sonarr, Radarr,</strong> etc - home theater with automated media management</li>
  <li><strong>nginx &amp; <a href="https://goaccess.io/" target="_blank">goaccess</a> analytics</strong> - something to tell me if anyone reads this blog</li>
  <li><strong>storage</strong> with off-site backup - a NAS backed up to B2</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>

<p>I have a Raspberry Pi 3B+, a 2011 Raspberry Pi, an old Windows laptop and two Odroid HC1s.
All devices are very low-end for kubernetes.
I will therefore be going for <a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank">k3s</a>, a lightweight, stripped-down kubernetes distribution crammed in a single binary.</p>

<p>The 2011 is apparently way too slow and not supported by k3s.
The 3B+ is supported but slow, needs to run off an SD card and is limited to USB2.0 and 100Mb ethernet.
It should do its job as master node.</p>

<p>The Odroids are better specced with an 8-core CPU, 2GB RAM and a SATA port.
They will serve as agent nodes doing the heavy lifting, as well as storage hosts.</p>

<h2 id="the-path">The path</h2>

<p>Since my current knowledge of kubernetes is that it‚Äôs something I somehow deploy things to at work, this should be a pretty fun ride.</p>

<p>Based on the excellent guides linked above, I plan to tackle the setup in this order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>prepare hardware and operating systems, install k3s</li>
  <li>configure load balancer, ingress controller, certificate management and DNS</li>
  <li>add persistent storage</li>
  <li>deploy apps</li>
</ol>

<p>It will probably take a lot of my time to understand how it all works, so I‚Äôll split this endeavor into multiple posts.
Let‚Äôs do this!</p>
